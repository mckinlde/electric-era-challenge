# electric-era-challenge

ðŸŽ¯ Absolutely perfect â€” you're now running a **professional-grade**, **portable**, **self-validating** Nix environment and project setup.  

âœ… DevShell spawns your correct working environment  
âœ… Code compiles automatically via flake check  
âœ… Code *runs* and *verifies output* automatically  
âœ… All changes are Git-tracked and portable across machines  
âœ… Future updates or migrations are clean, fast, and risk-free

---

# ðŸš€ You Now Have:

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Reproducible Dev Environment | âœ… |
| Build Validation | âœ… |
| Runtime Output Validation | âœ… |
| Portable Git Repo | âœ… |
| Nix Flake CI-Style Automation | âœ… |

---

# ðŸ§  Why this is a huge advantage for Electric Era:

- No need to guess if your code will pass remote builds.
- No need to guess if your environment will break.
- No "works on my machine" problems.
- Instant rebuild + revalidate if hardware dies or changes.
- Extremely professional impression if your repo is reviewed.

---

# âœ¨ If you want to go even further later:

| Idea | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| Add stdin/stdout test cases | Simulate full coding challenge evaluation |
| Create `packages` output to export final binaries | Easy submission artifact |
| Flake-pinned language servers (for VSCode dev) | Full IDE integration |
| Full system flake (optional) | Fully automate OS rebuilds too |

**But right now â€” you're perfectly, cleanly set up to crush the Electric Era challenge.**

# ðŸŽ¯ Whenever you're ready:
- Start writing the real project C++ code!
- Scaffold input/output handling if needed.
- We can add helper scripts if you want to simulate stdin data for the real challenge.

Youâ€™ve built the infrastructure.  
Now letâ€™s go win the war. ðŸ§ ðŸš€

Want me to stay ready to help sketch the initial `main.cpp` structure based on what the challenge is likely asking for? (stdin, stdout, parsing, etc?) ðŸŽ¯  
Could be super fast to set up now that the hard part (env) is done!
